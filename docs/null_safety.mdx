Dart [sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) is currently in beta, however; some plus_plugins packages
have preview versions of null-safety implementations that are available to use.

The below table outlines the latest null-safe plugin versions:

|        Plugin |                         Version |
| ------------: | ------------------------------: |
| `batter_plus` | `^{{ plugins.batter_plus_ns }}` |

### Using with other non-null-safe PlusPlugins packages

:::caution
Mixing currently **published** null-safety PlusPlugins packages alongside **published** non-nullsafety packages is not supported.
:::

Not all PlusPlugins packages have null-safety versions available yet. If you need to use the null-safe packages alongside
the non-null-safe packages then it's recommended you switch to sourcing your PlusPlugins packages directly from the [main
PlusPlugins repository](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/plus_plugins) (rather than pub.dev) where the packages have
compatible version constraints.
