## Using Share Plus

To use this plugin, add `share_plus` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://plus.fluttercommunity.dev/docs/overview).

## Example

Import the library.

```dart
import 'package:share_plus/share_plus.dart';
```

Then invoke the static `share` method anywhere in your Dart code.

```dart
Share.share('check out my website https://example.com');
```

The `share` method also takes an optional `subject` that will be used when
sharing to email.

```dart
Share.share('check out my website https://example.com', subject: 'Look what I made!');
```

To share one or multiple files invoke the static `shareXFiles` method anywhere in your Dart code. Optionally you can also pass in `text` and `subject`.

```dart
Share.shareXFiles(['${directory.path}/image.jpg'], text: 'Great picture');
Share.shareXFiles(['${directory.path}/image1.jpg', '${directory.path}/image2.jpg']);
```

If you are interested in the action your user performed with the share sheet, you can instead use the `shareWithResult` and `shareXFiles` methods.

```dart
final result = await Share.shareWithResult('check out my website https://example.com');

if (result.status == ShareResultStatus.success) {
    print('thank you for sharing my website!');
}
```

```dart
final result = await Share.shareXFiles(['${directory.path}/image.jpg'], text: 'Great picture');

if (result.status == ShareResultStatus.dismissed) {
    print('did you not like the picture?');
}
```
